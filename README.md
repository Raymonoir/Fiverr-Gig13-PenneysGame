# Fiverr-Gig13-PenneysGame
This was my 13th gig on Fiverr. The customer wanted a Java implementation of Penney's Game, a coin toss prediction game played by two players. The customer also wanted to be able to use this as a resource for learning so i added many detailed comments which will help them understand exactly what is happening within the code.
