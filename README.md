# Fiverr-Gig13-PenneysGame
This was my 13th gig on Fiverr. The customer wanted a Java implementation of Penney's Game, a coin toss prediction game played by two players. The customer also wanted to be able to use this as a resource for learning so i added many detailed comments which will help them understand exactly what is happening within the code.


<h1> Review Recieved </h1>
5* : 'Absolutely amazing work with great presentation. Also added comments that explained each part of the code which helped very much. Great work!'
