/**
 * 
 *  The Penney's Game is a game based on predicting coin tosses.
 *  Two players supply a string of H or T characters which represent heads or tails.
 *  The game then supplies random coin tosses, the first player to have their string matched wins
 * 
 *  I have added my own small addition by adding a 'difficulty' feature, if you initialise the 
 *  PenneysGame object and supply an integer, that becomes the guess length, a shorter guess length
 *  makes the game quicker or 'easier'
